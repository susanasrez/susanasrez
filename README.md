<h2 align="center" style="color: white;">👩‍💻 Data Science & AI Engineer (MSc Student)</h2>

<p align="center">
Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I am a Data Science and Engineering graduate currently pursuing a <strong>Double Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering and Applied Artificial Intelligence</strong> at <strong>Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)</strong>.
</p>

<p align="center">
My main interests lie in applied artificial intelligence, including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and the automation of data-driven processes. I enjoy working on projects that bridge research and real-world applications.
</p>

<h2 align="center" style="color: white;">🧠 A little about me</h2>
<p align="center">
I have hands-on experience developing and evaluating machine learning and deep learning models, particularly in computer vision and image segmentation, gained through academic projects and a data science internship at the Gran Telescopio de Canarias.  
My background includes working with Python-based AI ecosystems, data pipelines, and collaborative development tools.
</p>

<p align="center">
I consider myself a highly motivated and organized person, with strong analytical skills and the ability to communicate technical concepts clearly. I am especially interested in applying AI techniques—such as intelligent agents, NLP, and automation—to solve real-world business and research problems.
